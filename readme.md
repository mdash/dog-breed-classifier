# Dog Breed Classifier

A basic classifier application that takes an image and predicts the breed of dog. In case the image of a face has been provided, the application outputs the most similar looking dog breed.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Download a copy of the repository to your local machine

2. Refer to the requirements and get the requisite packages installed

3. Execute ```streamlit run app_dog_breeds.py``` on your terminal

4. Choose any of the sample images from the ```images_temp``` folder to test out the app

Note: I don't own any of the images in the specified folder and these are just provided so that we can test out the app out of the box. Please feel free to use your own images.

### Prerequisites

Please refer to the ```requirements.txt``` file for packages that are required for executing the app.
